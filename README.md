# Trading Platform [Java]

This system simulates a trading platform, where salesmen create sale offers for items that clients can later purchase. The sales process is mediated by markets, whose database (Data/Marketplaces.txt) must be supplied for the program to run. The state of the system is automatically saved after every user action and then loaded during the program's initialization.

No external libraries are required to compile this program.
